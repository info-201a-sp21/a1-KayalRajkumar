# UK variant of COVID-19 becomes dominant in the United States
The B.1.1.7 variant of COVID-19, originally discovered in the UK, is the now most common strain found in the United States of America. This strain is far more contagious and associated with higher death rates compared to any other strain the CDC has identified so far. Over the past few weeks, the number of cases in the United States has seen an increase which is believed to be due to the B.1.1.7 variant.
